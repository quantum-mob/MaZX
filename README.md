# MaZX

The ZX-calculus is a graphical language to describe linear maps on qubits.
In several aspects, it goes beyond quantum circuit model.

The ZX-calculus was first introduced by [Bob Coecke and Ross Duncan in 2007](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/GreenRed.pdf). This package was inspired by the MakeZXDiagram function by Janathan Gorard and Manojna Namuduri.
